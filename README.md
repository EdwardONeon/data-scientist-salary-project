# data-scientist-salary-project

An interactive Jupyter Notebook project focused on the exploration and analysis of the Data Scientist Salary 2023 dataset. This project serves as part of the coursework for MDS501 Introduction to Data Science Programming, providing hands-on experience in data science techniques and programming skills.

## Project Specification

### a. Conduct exploratory data analysis and characterize the dataset by:

i. Identifying numerical and categorical columns, and addressing missing values.

ii. Extracting key insights from summary statistics for numerical columns.

iii. Identifying unique job titles.

iv. Determining the number of distinct countries represented in the dataset.

### b. Employ various data analysis methods and appropriate visualizations to address the following queries:

i. Examine salary disparities across different countries.

ii. Determine the average income for a data scientist.

iii. Analyze changes in pay with increasing experience.

iv. Identify job roles associated with the highest earnings.

v. Summarize the average salary in USD by country.

### c. Conduct correlation analysis on the datasets and provide insights based on the results for:

i. Correlation between years of service and salary in local currency.

ii. Correlation between years of service and salary after currency conversion to USD.

iii. Correlation between salary in local currency and salary after conversion to USD.

iv. Correlation between years of service and the percentage of time spent working remotely.

v. Correlation between salary after conversion to USD and the percentage of time spent working remotely.

### d. Develop a menu application for data scientists to choose the desired output. The selection process should include three stages:

i. Data exploration.

ii. Data wrangling.

iii. Data processing and analysis.
